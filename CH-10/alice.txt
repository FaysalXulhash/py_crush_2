theNote that we are referencing two views—ListTodo and DetailTodo—that we have yet to create.
But the routing is now complete. There will be a list of all todos at the empty string '', in other
words at api/. And each individual todo will be available at its primary key, which is a value
Django sets automatically in every database table. The first entry is 1, the second is 2, and so on.
Therefore our first todo will eventually be located at the API endpoint api/1/.
